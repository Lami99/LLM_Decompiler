# LLM_Decompiler
Setup Guide
1. Decompiler setup
    Download Ghidra:
        Visit the Ghidra release page https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/releases and download the zip file named ghidra_release_PUBLIC_refNumber.zip from the assets of the selected release.

    Extract Ghidra:
        Unzip the downloaded file into the Decompiler directory ensuring that the contents are directly placed under this directory.

    Script Setup:
        Copy all scripts from Decompiler/decompilation_scripts to Decompiler/ghidra_11.0.1_PUBLIC/Ghidra/Features/Decompiler/ghidra_scripts.

    Update Ghidra Path:
        If using a Ghidra release different from 11.0.1, update the GHIDRA_PATH in the Decompiler/gd_decomp.sh script to match the version you have installed.

2. Change the openai key with you own key 
3. Dataset setup(optional: only if you want reproduce or extend the experiement described above)


Usage and Script Descriptions
1. analyze_all.sh

    Description: Automates the comprehensive analysis of executable files in a specified directory, identifying potential vulnerabilities and providing enhanced code analysis to improve security and maintainability.
    Usage: Execute the script with a directory path to perform analysis on all executables found therein:

    bash

    ./analyze_all.sh /path/to/directory

2. analyze_binary.sh

    Description: Decomposes executable files to source code and performs a vulnerability analysis to identify security risks in the decompiled code.
    Usage: Use this script by specifying the path to an executable:

    bash

    ./analyze_binary.sh path_to_executable

3. analyze_enhanced_binary.sh

    Description: Enhances the decompiled code for readability and maintainability before conducting a detailed vulnerability analysis to ensure comprehensive security assessments.
    Usage: Run the script by providing an executable's path:

    bash

    ./analyze_enhanced_binary.sh path_to_executable
4. analyze_source.sh

    Description: Evaluates source code files for vulnerabilities by generating detailed reports that highlight security flaws, helping developers to make informed security enhancements.
    Usage: Invoke this script with the path to a source code file:

    bash

    ./analyze_source.sh path_to_source_code

5. decompile_pipe.sh

    Description: Streamlines the process of decompiling executables into source code, simplifying the initial stages of security analysis by preparing the code for further inspection.
    Usage: Execute the script by passing the name of the executable:

    bash

    ./decompile_pipe.sh executable_name

6. large_code_base_reconstruction.py

    Description: Enhances large decompiled code bases using the OpenAI GPT-4 model, which can be switched to any other OpenAI model as needed. This script focuses on improving readability and maintainability by adding descriptive comments and renaming functions and variables.
    Usage: Execute the script by providing the path to a JSON file containing decompiled function data:

    python large_code_base_reconstruction.py path_to_decompiled_output_json

7. llm_d.py

    Description: Utilizes the OpenAI GPT-4 model to analyze decompiled code, identifying and cataloging vulnerabilities with an emphasis on minimizing false positives to ensure reliable security assessments. The model used can be adjusted to any other OpenAI model to suit different analysis needs.
    Usage: This script requires an input filename and outputs a detailed vulnerability report:

    python llm_d.py input_file_name

8. llm_f.py

    Description: Employs AI, specifically the OpenAI GPT-4 model, to filter out irrelevant functions from decompiled source code, retaining only those functions that are critical for understanding the codeâ€™s logic. This process aids in focusing subsequent analyses and can be adapted to use different OpenAI models.
    Usage: Run the script by specifying the path to the decompiled source code file:

    python llm_f.py path_to_decompiled_source_code

9. llm_r.py

    Description: Uses the OpenAI GPT-4 model to enhance the clarity of decompiled source code by intelligently renaming variables and adding explanatory comments. This enhancement aids in subsequent vulnerability assessments and maintenance, and the script can accommodate other OpenAI models as required.
    Usage: To enhance decompiled code, provide the filename of the decompiled code:

    python llm_r.py decompiled_code_file

Other usefull scripts are under helper_scripts directory, that can be usefull for batch analysis
