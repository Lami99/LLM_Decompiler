# Detailed Overview of process_juliet_suite.py
Functionality

The process_juliet_suite.py script is designed to streamline the preparation of the Juliet Test Suite for C/C++ by performing two primary functions:

    Directory Filtering: The script filters out directories that are not related to specific Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) numbers. This is particularly useful for focusing on relevant security weaknesses when working with large datasets.
    Code Standardization: It processes the C/C++ source files within the retained directories, replacing predefined strings to standardize certain text. This adjustment typically aims to obscure whether a particular function call in the source code is 'good' or 'bad', which can be important for blind testing and evaluation.

Customizable Components

To adapt the process_juliet_suite.py script to specific needs, you can modify the following elements:

    CWE Numbers (cwe_numbers_to_keep)
        This is a list of strings where each string represents the CWE number that you want to keep in the Juliet Test Suite.
        By modifying this list, you can tailor the dataset to include only the directories associated with the CWE numbers that are relevant to your specific security analysis or research focus.
        Example change:

        python
        cwe_numbers_to_keep = ["79", "89", "120", "352"]  # Focus on XSS, SQL injection, Buffer Overflow, and CSRF vulnerabilities.

2. select_from_cwe.py

  This script is designed to facilitate extracting a small number of test cases from the Juliet Test Suite. It randomly selects 'bad' files (which contain vulnerabilities) and their 'good' counterparts (which are corrected versions without vulnerabilities) from each CWE-specific directory that includes separate subdirectories for 'bad' and 'good' binaries. The samples will be saved under ../selected_binaries , which could be used as input to analyze_all.sh

    Customization Options

    To tailor the script for specific testing requirements, consider the following adjustments:

    Number of Samples (num_files): Adjust this parameter to change the number of 'bad/good' file pairs selected, allowing control over the scale of testing.

    python

    num_files = 5  # Set based on desired test suite size.


    python select_from_cwe.py /path/to/bad/files /path/to/good/files
    typically working with Juliet test suite this paths will look like:
    Dataset/juliet-test-suite-c-master/bin/CWE23/bad
    Dataset/juliet-test-suite-c-master/bin/CWE23/good
